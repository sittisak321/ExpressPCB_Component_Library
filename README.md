# The ProckNation ExpressPCB Component Library
This repository is the first step of the construction of the ProckNation ExpressPCB Component Library.  Once I have finished cleaning and organizing the files I will move the repository to the ProckNation GitHub site so that it can be managed by others and not just me.

## ExpressPCB Component Licensing
### For My Components
The MIT license posted in the main repository directory applies to all the parts and components that I have created.  You are free to use them for any purpose, just try to give credit in the documentation of your project.

### For Other Components I Found and Imported Over the Years
For the other files that I have imported the MIT license does not apply.  Most of them did not specify any type of use restriction so use them at your own discretion. 

## Future Plans for the Component Library
* In the near future I plan on digging through all the files and separating them into groups to better categorize them.
* I will also label them better so the source and/or author of the file will be more obvious.
* Once I have finished organizing the components I will move the library (repository) to the ProckNation GitHub site. (ProckNation site)[http://procknation.procknation.com]
