# Extra Components and Parts for ExpressPCB Schematic Capture and PCB Layout
This repository will store all of my personally created schematic components and custom PCB parts plus any that I have found on various web sites and have imported.  I am just going through all of my laptops and desktops and copying all the .s and .p files I can find.

## Parts and Components Licensing
### My Files
The MIT license posted in the repository applies to all the parts and components that I have created.  You are free to use them for any purpose, just try to give credit in the documentation of your project.

### Other Files Found and Imported Over the Years
For the other files that I have imported the MIT license does not apply.  Most of them did not specify any type of use restriction so you them at your own discretion.
