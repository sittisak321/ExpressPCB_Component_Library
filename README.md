# The ProckNation ExpressPCB Component Library
This repository is the first step of the construction of the ProckNation ExpressPCB Component Library.  Once I have finished cleaning and organizing the files I will move the repository to the ProckNation GitHub site so that it can be managed by others and not just me.

## Recent Updates
* 03-25-2015 : Added [PCBComponents_Custom-Directory_Listing.txt](https://github.com/zang206/ExpressPCB_Component_Library/blob/master/PCBComponents_Custom-Directory_Listing.txt), [SchComponents_Custom-Directory_Listing.txt
](https://github.com/zang206/ExpressPCB_Component_Library/blob/master/SchComponents_Custom-Directory_Listing.txt) files to the repository.  These files are just the names of all the files in the named directories which is also the names of the components as seen in the ExpressPCB program.  Since there is no way to search in the custom components group in ExpressPCB I put all the names in these files then put them into a two sheet Excel file. One sheet for schematic components and another sheet for PCB components. <br>When looking for a component it is much easier to just open the Excel sheet and search for the part there.  I also locked the cells, sheets, and workbook so while searching for parts, I don't accidentally delete some of the part names or anything.

## ExpressPCB Component Licensing
### For My Components
The MIT license posted in the main repository directory applies to all the parts and components that I have created.  You are free to use them for any purpose, just try to give credit in the documentation of your project.

### For Other Components I Found and Imported Over the Years
For the other files that I have imported the MIT license does not apply.  Most of them did not specify any type of use restriction so use them at your own discretion. 

## Future Plans for the Component Library
* In the near future I plan on digging through all the files and separating them into groups to better categorize them.
* I will also label them better so the source and/or author of the file will be more obvious.
* Once I have finished organizing the components I will move the library (repository) to the ProckNation GitHub site. [ProckNation GitHub site](http://procknation.procknation.com)
